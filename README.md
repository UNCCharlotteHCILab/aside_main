ESIDE
=============

Description:

This Branch is ESIDE. This is the educational version of ASIDE

Installation:

Troubleshooting:

Problem: Eclipse shows error "An Api baseline has not been set for the current workspace"
Solution: This result is expected. Please see the installation instructions above for resolution information

Problem: Eclipse shows about 100 "Java Problems" such as "abstract vm not resolved" and org.eclipse.jdt.launching cannot be resolved
Solution: This error sometimes occurs on Eclipse Luna and always occurs on prior versions. The best course of action is to upgrade to Eclipse Mars or newer. However, if you are using Eclipse Luna and wish to continue doing so, please delete the project from your workspace and try downloading again. Please also ensure that you are using Eclipse Luna for windows.
